## Problem Overview

Blindness presents significant challenges for those affected, making everyday tasks difficult. However, technology offers solutions to alleviate some of these challenges. This project focuses on developing a photo-to-speech application for the blind, called **Intelligent Eye**. The goal is to provide a tool that helps visually impaired individuals navigate independently without external assistance. By combining image and text processing, we aim to create a deep learning application that makes a meaningful impact on society, enabling visually impaired individuals to achieve greater independence.
