# Image-Caption-Generator
Welcome to the Image Caption Generator repository! This project utilizes deep learning techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. By leveraging state-of-the-art neural network models, the system can interpret the contents of an image and provide a coherent and relevant textual description.
Features
Advanced Neural Networks: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.
Pre-trained Models: Comes with pre-trained models like InceptionV3 for image encoding and LSTM for caption generation.
Custom Training: Allows for custom training on your own datasets to fine-tune and improve caption accuracy.
Flexible Input: Supports a variety of image formats and sizes.
Extensible Codebase: Easily extendable for experimenting with different network architectures and training techniques.
API Integration: Simple API setup for integrating the caption generator into other applications.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/muheet-m1/image-caption-generator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd image-caption-generator
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Generate Captions
To generate captions for your images, place the images in the input_images folder and run:

bash
Copy code
python generate_captions.py
The generated captions will be saved in the output_captions folder.

Training
To train the model on a custom dataset, ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format and run:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --data_dir /path/to/your/dataset
Examples
Input Image

Generated Caption
"A group of people riding horses on a beach."
